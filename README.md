# Julia Set in Manim
This repository visualizes Julia Set using Manim, a Python library for creating animated scenes.

I am still working on this project. I want to visualize the Julia Set by VMobject in manim eventually.

Also, 3B1B's `fractal.py` is based on either manimlib or manimgl, and I want to modify them to be more compatible with the manimCE library.
