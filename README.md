# JuliaSetinManim
This is a repository that visualize Julia Set by using manim in python.

I am still working with this project. I want to visuallize the JuliaSet by VMobject in manim finally

And by the way, 3B1Bâ€™s `fractal.py` is based on manimlib or manimgl, and I want to modify them to be more compatible with the manimCE library.
